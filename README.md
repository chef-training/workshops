# Chef SA Workshops

## Instructions

Complete the mandatory workshops below. These may be completed in any order, but it the recommendation is `1_MongoDB`, `2_Tomcat`, and then `4_Windows`.

* `1_MongoDB`
* `2_Tomcat`
* `3_Bonus`
* `4_Windows`

Each workshop includes instructions stating the goal of the workshop, the success criteria, and, in some cases, basic instructions.  Basic instructions are provided with the understanding that those executing the workshops may not have any practical experience with the specific technologies involved.

If the `1_MongoDB`,`2_Tomcat` and `4_Windows` workshops are completed successfully, additional bonus material from `3_Bonus` may be completed.  This is extra credit material and additional consideration will be given if it is attempted and/or completed successfully.

## Expectations

There are no correct or incorrect working solutions to each of the workshops.  If the participant's solution meets the defined success criteria, that is a correct solution.  Each individual is expected to use their own experiences and approach to solving the task at hand.

* Work will be shown on github
  * Create a free account on [github.com](https://github.com) if you do not have one
  * Fork this repository
  * Commit your work locally and often to show progress
  * Do not forget to push to your github repo!
  * Provide instructions in your README.md for us to run your cookbook so that we can test your work.

* Completing a Chef Essentials workshop or class
* Completing other online tutorials or training courses on Chef
* Real-world experience working with Chef

You will also need to install a few pieces of software on your local workstation:

* The [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/products/workstation) to develop and test your Chef code.
* A text editor to create and edit your Chef code (i.e. [Atom](https://atom.io), [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com), or other)
* A free [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account to upload your work
* A virtual machine running a RHEL7 (or later) based linux distribution (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) to serve as a test system
  * This can be a local or cloud-hosted VM
  >NOTE: Workshops in `3_Bonus` may require an Ubuntu-based operating system rather than RHEL7.  If required, it will be called out specifically within that workshop's README file.
