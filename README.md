# Chef Workshops

After completing some initial training on Chef, learners are often wondering where to go next to be successful with Chef.  This repository is a collection of ideas suitable for answering that question.

Workshop ideas can be used as training exercises, hack day projects, starter projects, etc.  

Great projects:

* Have multiple correct answers
* Have a begin and end state defined with plenty of room for the learner to find his or her way to the end state.  These are intentionally loosely defined.
* Can be facilitated or completed as self-study
* Can be extended in multiple directions based on learning objectives

## Projects Included

* Awesome Appliance Repair - A simple, python-based web application that utilizes Apache for a web server and MySQL for a database.
* Install MongoDB - A starter project for MongoDB.  This simply installs the software on the target system.
* Middleman - A static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development. It is a ruby (sinatra) application.
* Remediation Workshop - Use [Chef Inspec](inspec.io) to test and remediate a system.
* Tomcat - A simple installation and configuration of an Apache web page.
